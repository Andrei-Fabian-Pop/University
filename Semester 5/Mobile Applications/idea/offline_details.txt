Scenario: Offline Access for "Create User Profile" Operation:
- Offline Scenario: A user attempts to sign up and create a new user profile while offline, without an internet connection.
- Offline Behavior: In this scenario, the user can provide their information and set preferences, but the operation will fail to immediately synchronize with the server due to the lack of internet access.
- Local Database: The user's provided data and preferences are stored locally in the device's database.
- User Experience: The user can use the app with their created profile while offline but might not receive personalized content until an internet connection is available.
- Server Behavior: The server is unaware of the new user profile until an internet connection is reestablished, at which point the data is synchronized.


Scenario: Offline Access for "Update User Profile" Operation:
- Offline Scenario: A user wants to update their profile information (e.g., change their username or email) while offline.
- Offline Behavior: The user makes changes, but the updates cannot be immediately sent to the server.
- Local Database: The updated information is stored in the local database, reflecting the changes on the current device.
- User Experience: The user sees the updated profile information on the current device but knows that these changes are not yet synchronized with the server.
- Server Behavior: The server remains unaware of the changes until the device goes back online, at which point the updates are synchronized with the server.


Scenario: Offline Access for "Update Preferences" Operation:
- Offline Scenario: A user attempts to update their preferences (e.g., change selected news sources, categories, or themes) while offline.
- Offline Behavior: The user can modify their preferences, but these changes are not immediately reflected on the server.
- Local Database: The updated preferences are stored in the local database, and the user experiences the app with the new settings locally.
- User Experience: The user can view content based on the updated preferences on the current device but understands that these preferences might not apply on other devices or when the app is used online.
- Server Behavior: The server remains unaware of the preference changes until the device reconnects to the internet, at which point the preferences are synchronized.


Scenario: Offline Access for "Add News Article" Operation:
- Offline Scenario: An editor or contributor of the news application wants to add a new news article while offline, without an internet connection.
- Offline Behavior: The editor creates the news article, including the title, content, publication date, source, and category. However, the operation will fail to immediately synchronize with the server due to the lack of an internet connection.
- Local Database: The newly created news article is stored locally in the device's database.
- User Experience: The editor can create and view the news article on the local device, but it's not visible to other users or readers since it's not yet published on the server.
- Server Behavior: The server is unaware of the new news article until an internet connection is reestablished. Once online, the editor can synchronize the article with the server, making it available to all users.
